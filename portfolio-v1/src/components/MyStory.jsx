            <p className="myStory-info">Hey there! Buckle up for the ride because my passion story is a wild one! While most folks stumble upon their callings in unique ways, mine? Well, it all started with good ol&#39; <span className='hobbies'>curiosity</span>. You know how they say, &quot;Curiosity kills the cat&quot;? Well, in my case, it didn&#39;t kill; it woke her up and set her on fire!
            Yep, I&#39;m a proud veteran, a fearless firefighter, and now, hold onto your hats, a Full Stack Software Developer. I bring a mix of clear, clean-cut, and downright fun designs to all my projects. It&#39;s not just about coding for me; it&#39;s about infusing that zest into every line of code.
            And when I&#39;m not cooking up digital magic, you&#39;ll find me soaking up quality time with my awesome <span className='hobbies'>family</span>, diving headfirst into new <span className='hobbies'>learning</span> adventures, and, of course, keeping those muscles pumped with some serious <span className='hobbies'>workouts</span>. Life&#39;s a grand adventure, and I&#39;m here to make every moment count! ðŸš€ðŸ’»ðŸ”¥</p>
